          <p class="wyrm">I am the dragon so-called Dovah. And <a href="https://file.wyrm.host/">this</a>, is my hoard.</p>
          <p class="othr">You... don’t look like a dragon?</p>
          <p class="wyrm">Well, hardly anyone does these days. As times have changed so have we. The scales and tail worked with the dinosaurs, but we quickly learned that wasn't going to fly with you people.</p>
          <p class="othr">You were around all the way back to the dinosaurs?</p>
          <p class="wyrm">Well, not like, me, personally. How old do you think I am?</p>
          <p class="othr">...There’s no safe answer to that, is there?</p>
          <p class="wyrm">No.</p>
          <p class="othr">So... when you say this is your hoard...?</p>
          <p class="wyrm">All dragons have one. Some stick to the old gold and jewels thing, but that’s so cliché these days. Most of us like our hoards to be a little bit more sophisticated than 'shiny.'</p>
          <p class="othr">Like what?</p>
          <p class="wyrm">I have known dragons whom collect snowflakes from the first fall of the year over dozens of centuries. Dragons that collect the petals of flowers left on the graves of loved ones. Dragons that keep and care for soft toys and comfort items, left behind by children as they've grown up. Dragons that guard happy memories and shards of sunlight, kept safe for rainy days.</p>
          <p class="wyrm">As for myself, I have found my calling in the thinking machine's age, where I collect and hoard whichever suites my mind in the morning. Be it not just the famed works of noted names, but just so those of lesser praise, I catch that whichever catches my eye in the digital stream, and I do my best to uphold this sanctuary of information.</p>
          <p class="othr">Wow. So all these things... really mean a lot to you, huh?</p>
          <p class="wyrm">More than anything in this world.</p>
